## **A daily sudden decrease and increase in humidity (green).**

This pattern is more clear during weekends.

**My hypothesis:** This pattern probably happens when the AC is turned on and off.

## A sudden increase in humidity after sunlight exposure

This pattern happens sometimes after the sun has affected the environment by rising the temperature and lowering humidity. Of course, I ensured that the yellow line (temperature) corresponded with sunlight from my UV readings. 

**My hypothesis:** Could the AC be reacting to the sudden increase in temperature by working in cooling mode? 

If this is not the case, my other hypothesis could be related to false readings from the DHT22 I'm using, it may need recalibration after being affected by direct sunlight.
