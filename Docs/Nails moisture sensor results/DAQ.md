## Nail sensor with different angles between the nails

![Nail angle DAQ](/Docs/DAQ/nails-angle-daq.png)

Number indication:
1. nails' ends are closest together at 2cm inside the soil
2. nails' ends are at 3cm inside the soil
3. nails' ends are furthest at 5cm inside the soil
4. same as (3) with depth increasing


## Two nail sensor; one has new nails, and the other has corroded nails

![Nail corrosion DAQ](/Docs/DAQ/nails-good-vs-corroded-daq.png)

Number indication:
1. good nails
2. corroded nails

## Capacitive sensor with different depth

![Capacitive depth DAQ](/Docs/DAQ/capacitive-depth-daq.png)

Number indication:
1. sensor is inside the soil at the intended mark on its PCB
2. sensor is deeper inside the soil by 1cm below the mark
4. sensor is above the soil by 1cm above the mark
